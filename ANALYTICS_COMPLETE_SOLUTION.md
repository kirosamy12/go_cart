### 5. Data Visualization
- **Implementation**: Chart-ready data structures
- **Chart Types Supported**:
  - Line charts (trends)
  - Bar charts (comparisons)
  - Pie charts (distributions)
  - Area charts (cumulative data)

## API Endpoints

### Admin Endpoints
1. `GET /api/analytics/overall` - Platform-wide metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- MongoDB aggregation pipelines for efficient data processing
- Proper indexing for performance optimization
- Error handling for data inconsistencies

### Chart-Ready Data Structures
All endpoints return data in formats compatible with Chart.js:
```javascript
{
  labels: ["Label 1", "Label 2", ...],
  datasets: [{
    label: "Dataset Name",
    data: [value1, value2, ...],
    // Chart-specific styling
  }]
}
```

### Security
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (admin vs store owner)
- Input validation and sanitization

## Testing

### Unit Tests
File: `test/analytics.test.js`
- Tests for all controller functions
- Mock database calls for isolated testing
- Response structure validation

### Integration Considerations
